# A-Star-Theta-Star-Visualizer
A Python program to calculate and display the path found by the A-Star and Theta-Star Algorithms on a set of 100 blocked and unblocked cells.
A sample grid is provided, named "Grid.txt".
gridMaker.py will create a new grid in the Grid.txt File.
main.py runs the algorithm, calculating the A* and Theta* Paths and displaying them on a TKinter GUI.
If you input the x and y-coordinates of a vertex to the input box in the bottom right, the GUI will display its f, g, and h-values (If the vertex was visited when exploring for the optimal path).
